        <h2>Impact of AI on Job Automation</h2>
        <ul class="detail-list">
            <li><strong>Increased Efficiency:</strong> Automation of repetitive tasks in industries such as manufacturing and logistics leads to enhanced speed and productivity with less human involvement.</li>
            <li><strong>Shift in Job Demand:</strong> Demand for low-skilled jobs may decline, while new roles related to AI development, maintenance, and oversight become more prevalent.</li>
            <li><strong>Job Displacement:</strong> Sectors like transportation, customer service, and retail are at risk of job loss due to AI-powered systems replacing human tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Creation of New Roles:</strong> AI creates demand for new roles, such as AI specialists, data scientists, and robotic maintenance engineers, offering opportunities for skilled workers.</li>
            <li><strong>Re-skilling Needs:</strong> As tasks are automated, workers may need to learn new skills to transition into AI-compatible roles, requiring large-scale re-skilling initiatives.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost Savings for Businesses:</strong> Automating routine tasks can reduce labor costs, helping companies allocate resources more efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Impact on Customer Service:</strong> AI chatbots and virtual assistants handle customer interactions, reducing the need for human representatives in some service roles.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Inequality:</strong> As AI replaces certain jobs, income inequality may increase if displaced workers cannot adapt to new roles in the digital economy.</li>
