        <h2>Disadvantages of AI</h2>
        <ul class="detail-list">
            <li><strong>Job Losses:</strong> AI's ability to automate tasks may lead to significant job displacement, especially in repetitive or manual work, impacting workers in sectors like manufacturing, retail, and transportation.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy Concerns:</strong> AI often requires large amounts of data for effective analysis. This can lead to potential misuse of personal data, raising concerns about privacy and security.</li>
            <li><strong>Bias and Discrimination:</strong> AI systems can inherit biases present in their training data, resulting in unfair or discriminatory outcomes, particularly in areas like hiring or law enforcement.</li>
            <li><strong>High Development Costs:</strong> The initial cost of developing AI technologies is very high, making it inaccessible for small businesses and organizations with limited budgets.</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of Emotional Intelligence:</strong> Unlike humans, AI lacks empathy and emotional understanding, which can make interactions feel impersonal or mechanical, especially in customer service roles.</li>
            <li><strong>Dependency on AI:</strong> Over-reliance on AI could result in humans losing essential skills, decision-making abilities, and creative thinking due to reduced human involvement.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Risks:</strong> AI can potentially be misused for malicious purposes, such as developing more sophisticated cyber-attacks, threatening personal and national security.</li>
            <li><strong>Ethical Dilemmas:</strong> AI brings complex ethical questions, including accountability, transparency, and the moral implications of AI making decisions on our behalf.</li>
